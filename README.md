Advanced Analytics using PySpark

3.1. Analyze and Interpret Big Data
We need to learn and understand the data through at least 4 analytical methods
(descriptive statistics, correlation, hypothesis testing, density estimation, etc.). You need to
present your work numerically and graphically. Apply tooltip text, legend, title, X-Y labels etc. 
accordingly to help end-users for getting insights.
3.2. Design and Build a Classifier
a) Design and build a binary classifier over the dataset. Explain your algorithm and its 
configuration. Explain your findings into both numerical and graphical 
representations. Evaluate the performance of the model and verify the accuracy and 
the effectiveness of your model.
b) Apply a multi-class classifier to classify data into ten classes (categories): one normal 
and nine attacks (e.g., Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic,
Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms). Briefly explain your model with supportive
statements on its parameters, accuracy and effectiveness.
